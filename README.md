## Install

Docker Compose is required to run the script. Please refer to [Install Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) if you don't have one on
your system.

Then, clone this repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/wulab/nd004-build-an-item-catalog.git

You also need to have OAuth 2.0 client ID set in `docker-compose.yml` file.
See [Setting up OAuth 2.0](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849?hl=en&ref_topic=7013279)
for instructions. The redirect URI should be `http://localhost:8000/oauth2callback`.

## Usage

To run the app, issue the following command:

    $ cd nd004-build-an-item-catalog
    $ docker-compose up

The command will create an `app` service and start Flask built-in server on
port 8000. You will need to seed its SQLite database with initial data:

    $ docker-compose exec app flask initdb

Then, point your browser at http://localhost:8000/ to start using the app.

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the service. If you want to clean up everything, use:

    $ docker-compose down --rmi local --volumes

## Contribute

PRs not accepted. However, you can fork this repository and modify it under
your account. To facilitate app development, there's a
`docker-compose.development.yml` file you that can use. It will mount your
`app/src` directory to the one in the container which you can edit.

    $ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.development.yml up
